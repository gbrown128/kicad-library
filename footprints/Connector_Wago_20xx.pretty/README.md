# WAGO 2059/2060/2061 Series SMD Terminal Blocks

A handy set of terminal blocks from Wago.
I've extraced only the SMD versions here.
Imported into EAGLE, and transfered over to KiCad with a bit of manual tweaking.

Extracted from Wago's library here: https://www.wago.com/global/pcb-terminal-blocks-and-pluggable-connectors/smd-terminal-block-with-push-buttons-in-tape-and-reel-packing/p/2061-602_998-404#
I used Version 2.1, Nov 17, 2017. Extracted 2018-12-19.
